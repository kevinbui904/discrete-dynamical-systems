# discrete-dynamical-systems
This repository contains functions that allow easy use of compartmental models and a notebook with some examples. In the current state, it is intended to be used to analyze systems that have:
- discrete time steps, and
- consistent behavior that only depends on the current state.

Created as a part of a mathematical modeling seminar at Carleton College. Based on material in chapter 1 of _A Course in Mathematical Modeling_ by Douglas D. Mooney and Randall Swift.
